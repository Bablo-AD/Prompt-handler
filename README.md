# Prompt-handler
Prompt Handling package to build AI assistants and systems that interact with each other
## Journal Data
So now i want to get my software and hardware thing to improve. I envision of creating a JARVIS like assistant that connects with other AI tools to talk and make stuff so i need to create a base configuration that works and i can use it as a template to create all kind of AI models that are scalable, Create Standard protocols and make it openSource. My first AIM is to create that kind of AI prompt management tool that kind of takes care of stuffs
The Stuff it need to take care of 
- It needs to handle the messages
	- Token utilization and limiting
	- Load some header prompts
	- Roll the content prompts
	- Implement it like block chain like tech where it creates summary of the previous block
- It needs to be accessible through API like endpoints for other AI systems to interact
	- Use OPENAPI thing(I don't know what it is)
- It needs to have library of things doable
	- Something like the Minecraft guys at nividia did
		- It needs to be growable, used in model function parameter list
		- Make the model write what it is capable of (for assistants)
